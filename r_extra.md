## Professional Experience and Achievements

Mechanical Engineer, Avidyne Corporation, June 2007 to present

Mechanical Engineering Intern, Avidyne Corporation, May 2006 to May 2007

Design

• Designed large display versions (15 and 12 inch) of existing avionics. Specific problems included: 

o Heat dissipation from high-bright 15-inch display—conduction into the chassis

o Vibration concerns related to mounting electronics card cage designed for a 10” diagonal system to a 

15” diagonal system, specifically affecting air data and GPS cards.

• Reverse engineering of primary LCD

o Disassembled and created model of display on my own time for my own edification.

o Manager then said we’d be bringing the LCD ruggedizing in-house due to issues with contract 

manufacturer, and asked how long it would take for me to reverse engineer it. I responded “I already 

did”.

o Added features and improvements, such as CCFL wire strain relief, improved controller PCB 

mounting, reduction of tolerance stack-ups, slightly thinner overall geometry for better fit in unit.

• Designed improved EMI shielding for existing products.

Design Verification and Quality Improvement

• Root-cause investigations of failures of LCDs, cables, encoders. Discovered interferences and other 

issues in LCD redesign not perceived by senior mechanical engineer, ultimately leading to taking over as 

primary legacy product mechanical engineer.

• Performed DO-160 environmental testing. Also wrote test plans and test reports relating to environmental 

tests.

• Created performed analysis and wrote similarity arguments to circumvent costly testing. 

Engineering Drawings, CAD-use and Technical Writing

• Service center modification procedure writing

• Maintenance manual creation, editing and upkeep.

Extensive use of Solidworks for maintaining and creating drawings and large assemblies. Experience

with PDMworks.
