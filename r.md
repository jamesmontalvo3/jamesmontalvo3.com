Avidyne Corporation, Lincoln, MA
--------------------------------

### Mechanical Engineer June 2007-August 2008

* Designed New Map/GPS Product
  * Worked in a project management role, organizing procurement of prototype parts, coordinating electrical, software and mechanical engineering efforts, and pushing management and executives to make decisions on design concepts so the project could proceed quickly and efficiently.
  * Worked on human factors and improving user interface with better buttons, knobs and navigation pad (joystick).
  * Designed compact navigation pad for panning maps and navigating text. Complex tolerance analysis required to ensure appropriate button operation and uniform lighting from LEDs.
  * Designed hinged front panel, for easy access to internal electronic components for servicing in the field. Old designs required 40 screws to be removed. My design required ten and did not require removal from the radio rack. The design also had less tolerance stack-up for better fitting parts. 
* Designed large display versions (15 and 12 inch) of existing avionics. Specific problems included: 
  * Heat dissipation from high-bright 15-inch display—conduction into the chassis
  * Vibration concerns related to mounting electronics card cage designed for a 10-inch diagonal system to a 15-inch diagonal system, specifically affecting air data and GPS cards.
  * Coordinating with electrical engineers for PCB layout and planning.
  * Made human factors and aesthetics decisions in scaling 10” to 12” and 15”.
* Reverse engineering of primary LCD
  * Disassembled and created model of display for my own edification. Then the company decided to manufacture the LCD in-house and was I primary engineer on the project.
  * Added features and improvements, such as CCFL wire strain relief, improved controller PCB mounting, reduction of tolerance stack-ups, slightly thinner overall geometry for better fit in unit.
* Designed improved EMI shielding for existing products.

### Mechanical Engineering Intern May 2006-May 2007

* Root-cause investigations of failures of LCDs, cables, encoders. Discovered interferences and other issues in LCD redesign not perceived by senior mechanical engineer, ultimately leading to taking over as primary legacy product mechanical engineer.
* Performed DO-160 environmental qualification testing: Vibration, Operational Shock, Crash Safety, Humidity, Altitude, Decompression, Overpressure, Temperature, Temperature Variation
* Performed Flammability Tests to verify components meet UL94, DO-160, FAR.
* Performed analysis and wrote similarity arguments as design verification to circumvent costly testing.
